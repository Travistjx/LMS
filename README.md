# ABOUT
The Library Management System (LMS) is a web application designed to efficiently manage books in a library setting. Built with Java Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, HTML, and CSS, this system provides a user-friendly interface for librarians and library staff to handle book inventory, user accounts, and borrowing transactions, as well as for the regular users or library patrons to browse the book catalog, manage their loans, fines and payments.

# INSTALLATION / SETUP


# REFLECTION
This is a personal project which main purpose is for me to learn Spring Boot with. 
What I wanted to build is a library management system that fulfills the basic needs, which is to manage the book inventory, the ongoing loans, fines and payments.
